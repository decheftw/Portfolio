# Testing for Maze Solver

## Testing for `AMStartup.c`

### Overview

All levels were tested with 10 avatars (log files not shown).

The log files for levels 0-3 demonstrate succesful runs using 3 avatars.

The log files for levels 4-8 demonstrate succesful runs using 5 avatars.

Testing for level 9 took around 20 minutes to complete.

Tests for edge cases (nAvatars = 0 or 1) were handled properly.
